Your task is to create a Python program that implements a simple system 
for uploading and downloading files using a client-server architecture.
The server should have a defined folder on the computer where the files will be stored
Requirements:

    Implement a server program that listens for incoming connections from clients.

    Clients should be able to upload files to the server.

    The server should store the uploaded files in a predefined folder.

    Clients should be able to request and download files from the server.

What the code does:

The server listens on a specific port for incoming connections.
The client connects to the server's IP address and port.
The client sends the filename to the server.
The server validates the filename and creates a path to store the uploaded file in a designated directory.
The client sends the file data in chunks to the server.
The server receives and saves the file data.
The server sends a confirmation message to the client.
